Hi there, my name is Joy. I work as a Software Developer. This blog is for any 
topics that I find interesting, including but not limited to the following: 
CS, Math, Finance, Economics, and more. 

When I'm not working, you can catch me going outside for nice walks, playing with my dog, or watching movies/kdramas. 

I created this blog as an outlet to practice getting better at writing skills. Also, I believe that trying to convey information in a simple, yet easy to digest manner to a wider audience helps you to better understand it. 

Sometimes, when I'm feeling tired, and am too time constrained to work on a personal project, I may try and make a blogpost on something I find interesting.
